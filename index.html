          <p>Rachel is a fiesty red-head from Memphis. She is a mom to 3 grown children. Her oldest is 31 this year and her youngest will turn 21 this year. She has 2 daughters and 1 son. The children are a bit of jealous of their fur-sister Luna. They say that Luna is my favorite child. They may be RIGHT! Just kidding!!  Rachel grew up playing a total of 5 different instruments. She started with guitar and piano in elementary school. Rachel didn't like her piano classes much so, after her 1st semester of piano, she taught herself the rest and used to play songs by Elvis, Lionel Ritchie, and Journey to name a few. She then proceeded to learn the clarinet and was in the marching band. There she traded instruments with other students to learn their instruments as well... the flute and piccolo. Rachel was also a member of the color guard where she twirled flags and rifles. Her 1st year in the high school band was amazing and because the band was one of the top performing marching bands in the mid-south, she and her bandmates were invited to perform in the parade at Disney World! High school is also where Rachel got her 1st taste of programming, too! There she took the Basic Programming. It was the first class on programming ever taught at the school. She was quite gifted at it and her teacher pushed for her to go to the local college and attend their new computer science degree program while, her automotive (did I forget to mention she took auto mechanics in HS) teacher wanted her to combine her skills with computers with her knowledge of cars in the new program (automotive technician) that was also being offered at that same local college.</p>
